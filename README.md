# DS-SocProject
Educational project focused on the technical analysis of digital scams and web application vulnerabilities from a SOC (Blue Team) perspective. The project uses controlled lab environments to study common weaknesses, understand how they are abused in real-world fraud scenarios, and discuss detection, mitigation, and prevention strategies.
